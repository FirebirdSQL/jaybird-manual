== Supported JDBC Scalar Functions

The JDBC API has an escaped syntax for numeric, string, time, date, system and conversion functions.
Jaybird will try to provide an equivalent of the JDBC function using the built-in capabilities of the Firebird database.
When no equivalent is available, Jaybird will pass the function call "as is" to the database assuming that it contains the necessary UDF, UDR or stored function declaration.

Not all functions described in the JDBC specification have corresponding built-in functions in Firebird, but some are available in the standard UDF library ``ib_udf``{wj}footnote:[On Windows platform it is represented by the `ib_udf.dll`, on Linux it is represented by the `libib_udf.so`.] shipped with Firebird.
Jaybird provides a connection parameter `use_standard_udf` to configure the driver to assume that functions from that UDF are available in the database ([.until]_Jaybird 5_).
In this case Jaybird will convert all JDBC function calls into the corresponding calls of the UDF functions.

In recent Firebird versions, the number of built-in functions has been greatly increased, and Jaybird 3 and higher can now map almost all JDBC escapes to those built-in functions.
Using the `use_standard_udf` is no longer advisable, especially as UDFs are now deprecated and will be removed in a future Firebird version.
[.since]_Jaybird 5_ UDF mode (`use_standard_udf`) is no longer available in Jaybird 5 and higher.

Below you will find the list of JDBC functions and whether they have a corresponding equivalent in the "built-in" and in the "UDF" modes.

|Description

|CONVERT(value, SQLtype)

|X
a|`value` converted to `SQLtype` where `SQLtype` may be one of the following SQL types:

* `BIGINT`
* `BINARY`
* `BLOB`
* `CHAR`
* `CLOB`
* `DATE`
* `DECFLOAT`
* `DECIMAL`
* `DOUBLE`
* `DOUBLE PRECISION`

* `TIME_WITH_TIME_ZONE`
* `TIMESTAMP`
* `TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE`
* `TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIME_ZONE`
* `TINYINT`
* `VARBINARY`
* `VARCHAR`

These type names can also be prefixed with `SQL_`.

|===

Legend: X -- available in this mode.

The `CONVERT` escape provides some additional features, or deviates from the JDBC defined behaviour:

* Contrary to the JDBC specification, we allow explicit length or precision and scale parameters
* `(SQL_)VARCHAR`, `(SQL_)NVARCHAR` (and _value_ not a parameter (`?`)) without explicit length is converted using `TRIM(TRAILING FROM value)`, which means the result is `VARCHAR` except for blobs where this will result in a blob;
national character set will be lost.
If _value_ is a parameter (`?`), and no length is specified, then a length of 50 will be applied (cast to `(N)VARCHAR(50)`).
* `(SQL_)CHAR`, `(SQL_)NCHAR` without explicit length will be cast to `(N)CHAR(50)`
* `(SQL_)BINARY`, and `(SQL_)VARBINARY` without explicit length will be cast to `(VAR)CHAR(50) CHARACTER SET OCTETS`.
With explicit length, `CHARACTER SET OCTETS` is appended.
* `(SQL_)LONGVARCHAR`, `(SQL_)LONGNVARCHAR`, `(SQL_)CLOB`, `(SQL_)NCLOB` will be cast to `BLOB SUB_TYPE TEXT`, national character set will be lost
* `(SQL_)LONGVARBINARY`, `(SQL_)BLOB` will be cast to `BLOB SUB_TYPE BINARY`
* `(SQL_)TINYINT` is mapped to `SMALLINT`
* `(SQL_)ROWID` is not supported as length of `DB_KEY` values depend on the context
* `(SQL_)DECIMAL` and `(SQL_)NUMERIC` without precision and scale are passed as is.
In current Firebird versions, this means the value will be equivalent to `DECIMAL(9,0)`/`NUMERIC(9,0)`, which is equivalent to `INTEGER`.
* Unsupported/unknown _SQLtype_ values (or invalid length or precision and scale) are passed as is to cast, resulting in an error from the Firebird engine if the resulting cast is invalid
