== Obtaining a connection

Jaybird is a regular JDBC driver and supports two primary ways to obtain connection: via
`java.sql.DriverManager` and via an implementation of the `javax.sql.DataSource` interface.

=== Obtaining connection java.sql.DriverManager

`java.sql.DriverManager` was the first connection factory in Java. It is based on the concept of the
JDBC URL, a string that uniquely identifies the database to which user wants to connect. The driver
manager then checks which driver(s) - if any - can establish a connection.

There is also support to specify additional connection parameters, like user name and password.

A JDBC URL consists of three parts:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/c:/database/example.fdb
....

* `jdbc` +
JDBC protocol
* `firebirdsql` +
JDBC subprotocol, identifies driver to use
* `//localhost:3050/c:/database/example.fdb` 
+
RDBMS specific part, identifies the database to which the driver must connect, in our case that is
`//<host>:<port>/<path to database>`

The first part, `jdbc:firebirdsql:` is required by JDBC and specifies the so called protocol and 
subprotocol for the JDBC connection. In other words, the type of the connection that the application
wants to obtain, in our case it is a connection to a Firebird database. 

An example of obtaining the connection is shown below.

[source,java]
.Simple example to obtain a JDBC connection
----
package hello;

import java.sql.*;

public class HelloServer {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  
    Class.forName("org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver"); // <1>
    
    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection( 
      "jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/c:/db/employee.fdb",
      "SYSDBA", "masterkey"); // <2>
      
    // do something here
  }
}
----

The first line of this code is important â€“ it tells JVM to load the Jaybird JDBC driver. According to
the JDBC specification, at this point driver registers itself in `java.sql.DriverManager`.

Since Java 6 (JDBC 4), explicitly loading the driver using `Class.forName("org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver")`
is no longer necessary, except when the driver is not on the system class path. Examples where it
may be necessary to explicitly load the driver are web applications that include the driver in the
deployment. There the driver is not on the system classpath and needs to be loaded explicitly.

We will leave out usages of `Class.forName` in future examples.

.Registering the JDBC driver
[NOTE]
====
There are several ways to register JDBC driver:

1. The JVM loads the driver from the system class path. This happens automatically.

2. The application explicitly loads the driver's class. This is only necessary if the automatic
loading (see previous item) is not available. This can be necessary because the driver `jar` is 
loaded dynamically, through a different classloader, etc).
+
The JDBC specification requires that during class initialization the driver registers itself with
`DriverManager`.
+
....
Class.forName("org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver");
....
3. The JDBC driver is listed in a `jdbc.drivers` system property. For example in your 
`~/.hotjava/properties` file you can specify following line:
+
....
jdbc.drivers=foo.Driver:org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver
....
+
Alternatively you can specify the value of this property during JVM startup:
+
....
java\
  -Djdbc.drivers=org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver\
  -classpath jaybird-full-{jaybird-full-version}.jar;C:/myproject/classes\
  my.company.SomeJavaExample
....
====

The second statement of the example tells the `java.sql.DriverManager`
to open database connection to the Firebird server running on the host
where the Java code is executed, and the path to the database is
`c:/database/employee.fdb`.

The database specification consists of the name of the server where the database server resides, 
optionally you can specify a port to which the driver will connect (by default port 3050 is used).
The server name can be specified using either its DNS name (for example `fb-server.mycompany.com` or
just `fb-server`), or its IP address (for example `192.168.0.5`, or `[1080::8:800:200C:417A]` for 
an IPv6 address).

After the server name and port, the alias or path to the database is specified. We suggest to specify
a database alias instead of the absolute database path. For more information about using aliases see
the documentation of Firebird server.

The format in which the path is specified depends on the platform where the Firebird server runs. 

On Windows it must include the drive letter and path, for example `c:/database/employee.fdb`, which
points to the employee database that can be found in a root directory of drive C:. Java (and 
Firebird) allows you to use either `/` or `\\` as path separator on the Windows platform. On Unix
and Linux platform, you can use only `/` as the path separator.

On Unix platforms the path must include the root, as the path is otherwise interpreted relative to
a server-dependent folder. Having to include the root has the effect that a database in
`/var/firebird/employee.fdb` needs to use a double `//` after the host name (and port) in the 
connection string: `jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost//var/firebird/employee.fdb`

It is possible to specify a relative path, but as this is highly dependent on the server
configuration, we suggest you not to use this, and instead use an alias.

==== Specifying extended properties

What if we want to specify additional connection parameters, a client
encoding, for example? JDBC specification provides a method that
allows to specify additional connection properties:

[source,java]
.Obtaining JDBC connection with additional connection properties
----
package hello;

import java.sql.*;
import java.util.*;

public class HelloServerWithEncoding {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    
    props.setProperty("user", "SYSDBA");
    props.setProperty("password", "masterkey");
    props.setProperty("encoding", "UTF8");
    
    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
      "jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/C:/db/employee.fdb",
      props);
      
    // do something here
  }
}
----

Additional properties, for example SQL role for the connection can be
added to the `props` map. The list of all available extended properties
can be found in <<Extended connection properties>>.

However, it is not always possible to use the above described method.
Jaybird also provides a possibility to specify extended properties in the
JDBC URL. The example below shows the specification for specifying
extended JDBC properties in the URL.

.Extended JDBC URL format
....
jdbc:firebirdsql://host[:port]/<path to db>?<properties>
<properties> ::= <property>[{& | ;}<properties>]
<property>   ::= <name>[=<value>]
....

In this case extended properties are passed together with the URL using
the HTTP-like parameter passing scheme: first comes the main part of the
URL, then `"?"`, then name-value pairs separated with `&` or `;`. The code below
is equivalent to the previous example.

[source,java]
.Specifying extended properties in the JDBC URL
----
import java.sql.*;

...

Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/C:/db/employee.fdb?encoding=UTF8",
    "SYSDBA",
    "masterkey");
----

==== Obtaining a connection via javax.sql.DataSource

The JDBC 2.0 specification introduced a mechanism to obtain database connections without
requiring the application to know any specifics of the underlying JDBC driver. The application is
only required to know the logical name to find an instance of the `javax.sql.DataSource` interface
using Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). This is a common way to obtain connections in web
and application servers.

In order to obtain a connection via `DataSource` object, you can use the code shown below. This code
assumes that you have correctly configured the JNDI properties. For more information about 
configuring JNDI please refer to the documentation provided with your web or application server.

[source,java]
.Typical way to obtain JDBC connection via JNDI
----
package hello;

import java.sql.*;
import javax.sql.*;
import javax.naming.*;

public class HelloServerJNDI {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  
    InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();
    DataSource ds = (DataSource)ctx.lookup("jdbc/SomeDB");

    try (Connection connection = ds.getConnection()) {
      // do something here... 
    }
  }
}
----

Usually, the binding between the `DataSource` object and its JNDI name
happens in the configuration of your web or application server. However
under some circumstances (e.g. you are developing your own JNDI-enabled
application server/framework) you have to do this yourself. You can use
this code snippet for this purpose:

[source,java]
.Programmatic way to instantiate javax.sql.DataSource implementation
----
import javax.naming.*;
import org.firebirdsql.ds.*;
...
FBSimpleDataSource ds = new FBSimpleDataSource();

ds.setDatabase("//localhost:3050/C:/database/employee.fdb");
ds.setUser("SYSDBA");
ds.setPassword("masterkey");

InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();

ctx.bind("jdbc/SomeDB", ds);
----

The `DataSource` implementation supports all connection properties available
to the `DriverManager` interface.

Note that since version 3.0, Jaybird no longer provides a connection pool. If you need
a `javax.sql.DataSource` implementation that provides a connection pool. consider using https://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/[HikariCP], 
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/[DBCP], or http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/[c3p0].

=== Driver types

As was mentioned in the section <<Jaybird Architecture>>, Jaybird supports multiple 
implementations of the GDS API. The default Jaybird distribution contains two main
categories of the implementations: the pure Java implementation of the
Firebird wire protocol, and a JNA proxy that can use a Firebird `fbclient` library.

Below you find the list of existing types and their short configuration
description with the corresponding JDBC URLs that should be used to
obtain the connection of desired type. The type of the JDBC driver for
the `javax.sql.DataSource` is configured via corresponding property.

==== PURE_JAVA type

The PURE_JAVA driver type uses a pure Java implementation of the Firebird
wire protocol. This type is recommended for connecting to a remote
database server using TCP/IP sockets. No installation is required except
adding the JDBC driver to the class path. This type of driver provides
best performance when connecting to the remote server.

In order to obtain connection using the PURE_JAVA driver type you have
to use JDBC URL that was shown in <<Obtaining connection java.sql.DriverManager>>:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql://host[:port]/<path to database>
....

When using `javax.sql.DataSource` implementation, you can specify either
`"PURE_JAVA"` or `"TYPE4"` driver type, however this type is used by
default.

==== NATIVE and LOCAL types

The NATIVE and LOCAL driver types use a JNA proxy to access the Firebird
client library and requires installation of the Firebird client. The
NATIVE driver type is used to access the remote database server, the
LOCAL type accesses the database server running on the same host by
means of IPC. Performance of NATIVE driver is approximately 10% lower
compared to the PURE_JAVA driver, but LOCAL type has up to 30% higher
performance compared to the PURE_JAVA driver when connecting the server
on the same host. This is mostly due to the fact that TCP/IP stack is
not involved in this mode.

In order to instantiate a connection using the NATIVE JDBC driver to
connect to a remote server you have to use the following JDBC URL with
new subprotocol:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql:native:host[/port]:<path to database>
....

When connecting to a local database server using the LOCAL driver, you
should use following:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql:local:<absolute path to database>
....

In addition to Jaybird, this requires a native Firebird client library.

===== Windows

On Windows, you need to make sure that `fbclient.dll` is located on the
`PATH` environment variable. Alternatively you can specify the directory
containing this DLL in the `jna.library.path` system property.

For example, if you put a copy of `fbclient.dll` in the current directory you have to use
the following command to start Java:

....
java -Djna.library.path=. com.mycompany.MyClass
....

===== Linux

On Linux, you need to make sure that `libfbclient.so` is available through 
the `LD_PATH` environment variable.

Usually shared libraries are stored in the `/usr/lib/` directory; however you will need 
root permissions to install the library there. Note that some distributions will only have,
for example, `libfbclient.so.2.5`. In that case you will need to add a symlink.

Alternatively you can specify directory containing the library in the `jna.library.path` 
Java system property. See the Windows example above for more details.

===== Limitations

*TODO* Section might be outdated

Firebird client library is not thread-safe when connecting to a local
database server using IPC. Jaybird provides the necessary
synchronization in Java code using a static object instance. However,
this static object instance is local to the classloader that has loaded
the Jaybird classes.

In order to guarantee correct synchronization , the Jaybird driver must
be loaded by the top-most classloader. For example, when using the Type
2 JDBC driver with a web or application server, you have to add the
Jaybird classes to the main classpath (for example, to the `lib/`
directory of your web or application server), but *not* to the web or
J2EE application, e.g. the `WEB-INF/lib` directory.

==== EMBEDDED type

The Embedded server JDBC driver is the Type 2 JDBC driver that, rather
than using the Firebird client library, loads the Firebird embedded server
library instead. This is the highest performance type of JDBC driver for
accessing local databases, as the Java code accesses the database file
directly.

In order to obtain a connection via DriverManager you have to use
following URL:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql:embedded:<path to database>

jdbc:firebirdsql:embedded:host[/port]:<path to database>
....

When host and, optionally, port is specified, embedded server acts as
client library (i.e. you get the same Type 2 behavior as you would get
with using "native").

This driver tries to load `fbembed.dll/libfbembed.so` and `fbclient.dll/libfbclient.so`,
the last - of course - only works if that fbclient provides Firebird embedded.

See also the <<NATIVE and LOCAL types>> section.

When using Firebird 3 embedded, you will need to make sure the necessary plugins like
`engine12.dll/libengine12.so` are accessible to the client library, consult the 
Firebird 3 documentation for more information. *TODO* Extend documentation

===== Limitations

*TODO* Section might be outdated

The Firebird embedded server for Linux is not thread safe. Jaybird
provides the needed synchronization in Java code, similar to the one
described for the Type 2 JDBC driver. This implies the same restrictions
on the classloader that will load the Jaybird classes.

The Firebird embedded server for Windows opens databases in exclusive
mode. This means that this particular database is accessible only to one
Java virtual machine. _There is no exclusive mode on the POSIX platform.
When the same database file is accessed by multiple JVM instances,
database will be corrupted!_

=== Connection Pooling

Each time a connection is opened via `DriverManager`, a new physical
connection to server is opened. It is closed when the connection is
closed. In order to avoid the overhead of creating connections, you should use 
a connection pool implementation can maintain a cache of open physical
connections that can be reused between user sessions.

=== The javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource implementation

WARNING: The code presented in this section is deprecated and not
correct/typical usage

`FBConnectionPoolDataSource` is an implementation of the
`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` interface, which is used by an
application to obtain `PooledConnection` objects. A `PooledConnection`
instance represents a physical connection to a database and is a source
of logical connection. Closing a logical connection returns the physical
connection back into the pool. Additionally, the logical connection
provides caching of prepared statements, which improves application
performance even more than connection pooling.

Usually the connection pool is specified in web or application server
configuration. However, you can instantiate it also inside the
application.

[source,java]
.Example of instantiating and using the javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource implementation
----
package hello;

import java.sql.*;
import javax.sql.*;
import org.firebirdsql.pool.*;

public class HelloConnectionPool {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  
    org.firebirdsql.pool.FBConnectionPoolDataSource pool = 
      new org.firebirdsql.pool.FBConnectionPoolDataSource(); // <1>
      
    pool.setMaxPoolSize(5); // <2>
    pool.setMinPoolSize(2);
    pool.setMaxStatements(10);
    pool.setMaxIdleTime(30 * 60 * 60);
    
    pool.setDatabase("localhost/3050:C:/db/employee.fdb"); // <3>
    pool.setUser("SYSDBA");
    pool.setPassword("masterkey");
    
    // obtain a physical connection to the database
    PooledConnection pooledCon = pool.getPooledConnection(); // <4>
    
    // obtain a wrapped connection    
    Connection connection = pooledCon.getConnection(); // <5>
    try {
      // do something here...
    } finally {
      // release the connection back to pool
      connection.close(); // <6>
    }
  }
}
----

In the code above we perform the following steps:

<1> Create a connection pool object. In this example we
create instance implementing the `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`
interface.

<2> Now we specify the pooling properties: maximum of 5
physical connections, with minimum of 2, and each connection will
maintain a cache of 10 prepared statements of the same type (i.e. with
the same SQL). Connections in the pool that are idle for more than half
an hour (30 * 60 * 60 seconds) are closed automatically.

<3> After specifying the pooling properties we set the
database connection properties. In our case that is only database path,
user name and password, but also any other supported property can be set
here.

<4>  Having configured the data source, we obtain the physical
connection to the database. Our data source implementation will check
the internal connection pool and will open a new physical connection to
the database if the pool is empty. An instance of
`javax.sql.PooledConnection` represents a physical connection to the
database. Calling the `PooledConnection.close()` method will close the
physical connection to the database and will remove this connection from
the pool.

<5>  Now we obtain regular JDBC connection to the database and
perform the needed work.

<6>  At the end of processing we close the JDBC connection, but
note that we do not close the physical connection, but simply forget the
reference to it.

Please pay especial attention to the steps 4, 5 and 6. They show the
typical approach of using the JDBC connections in case of connection
pooling. The step 4 is to some extent optional â€“ if we use
`javax.sql.DataSource` connection factory, it provides already wrapped
JDBC connections doing the step 4 implicitly.

However it must be a rule for an application to use the `try/finally`
block to release the connection. In the XXX chapter we will discuss the
transaction boundaries and how they can influence that connection
handling, but for the code running in the J2EE environment the
`try/finally` guarantees that connections are never leaked in the
application code, the container will take care for the rest.

List of all pool-related properties can be found in
"<<Pool Properties>>" and "<<Runtime Pool Properties>>".

=== Using FBConnectionPoolDataSource with JNDI

WARNING: The code presented in this section is deprecated and not
correct/typical usage

Connection pooling is tightly coupled with the Java Naming and Directory
Interface, which provides a network-transparent hierarchical mapping of
the symbolic references to objects. As it was showed in
<<Obtaining a connection via javax.sql.DataSource>>, pooled connections are obtained
from JNDI using a symbolic reference, a JNDI name. When an application
binds an object into JNDI, typically following happens:

* If object implements `java.io.Serializable` interface, object is
directly bound to the specified name. If application accesses the JNDI
from the local JVM, a reference to the object bound in JNDI is returned.
If application accesses the JNDI from remote JVM, a serialized copy of
an object is sent over the wire to the remote node, where it is
deserialized and returned to the application
* If object implements `javax.naming.Referencable` interface, JNDI
implementation binds the so-called reference instead of an object.
Reference contains all necessary information to reconstruct the object
regardless of the JVM in which this operation happens. This is performed
with the help of so-called object factories. Object factory knows how to
convert instance of `javax.naming.Reference` into an appropriate object.
* If object implements none of the above mentioned interfaces, the
behavior is undefined. Usually JNDI provider allows to access bind
objects in local JVM, but when access happens in remote JVM, an
exception is thrown.

`FBConnectionPoolDataSource` implements both `java.io.Serializable`* and
`javax.naming.Referencable` interfaces. The code below shows how to
create and bind the JNDI reference for a `FBConnectionPoolDataSource`
class:

[source,java]
.Example of initializing and binding FBConnectionPoolDataSource reference
----
package hello;

import javax.naming.*;
import org.firebirdsql.pool.*;

public class HelloBindJndi {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  
    Reference ref = new Reference(
        "org.firebirdsql.pool.FBConnectionPoolDataSource"); // <1>
        
    ref.add(new StringRefAddr("maxPoolSize", "5")); // <2>
    ref.add(new StringRefAddr("minPoolSize", "2"));
    ref.add(new StringRefAddr("maxStatements", "10"));
    ref.add(new StringRefAddr("maxIdleTime", "108000"));
    
    ref.add(new StringRefAddr("database",
        "localhost/3050:C:/db/employee.fdb)); // <3>
    ref.add(new StringRefAddr("user", "SYSDBA"));
    ref.add(new StringRefAddr("password", "masterkey"));
    
    Context ctx = new InitialContext(); // <4>
    ctx.bind("jdbc/test", ref);
  }
}
----

<1> Create reference instance for the
`FBConnectionPoolDataSource`. According to the JNDI specification we
could specify another type here, however the identifier specified here
is used later by the object factory to check whether it is responsible
for materializing the specified reference. Our object factory accepts
only references with the ID equal to
`"org.firebirdsql.pool.FBConnectionPoolDataSource"`.

<2> Fill the pooling properties as reference addresses.

<3> Fill the database connection properties. Steps 2 and 3
look quite strange from the programming point of view, especially
compared to the previous section. However, this approach is very elegant
if we consider reading the configuration from the file. In this case we
no longer have to use Java reflection to set needed properties â€“ object
factory does it for us.

<4> Create JNDI initial context and bind the reference to
the specified name.

The next example shows how to access the FBConnectionDataSource bound in
previous example:

[source,java]
.Example of accessing the FBConnectionPoolDataSource via reference
----
package hello;

import java.util.*;
import javax.naming.*;
import org.firebirdsql.pool.*;

public class HelloLookupJndiFactory {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  
    Hashtable props = new Hashtable(); // <1>
    
    props.put(
        "java.naming.factory.initial",
        "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory"); // <2>
        
    props.put(
        "java.naming.factory.object", 
        "org.firebirdsql.pool.FBConnectionPoolDataSource"); // <3>
        
    Context ctx = new InitialContext(props);
    FBConnectionPoolDataSource pool = 
      (FBConnectionPoolDataSource)ctx.lookup("jdbc/test"); // <4>
  }
}
----

<1> Create an environment for the JNDI initial context.

<2> Specify the "java.naming.factory.initial" property. Our
example uses Sun file system JNDI provider. In J2EE environment this
property should match the one used by J2EE container. Additionally one
has to specify the "java.naming.provider.url" when accessing remote JVM.

<3> Specify the "java.naming.factory.object" property. In
our case it contains only one object factory â€“ our pool class itself. In
J2EE environment one has to configure the environment correctly.

<4> Create JNDI context and perform the JNDI lookup.

=== The javax.sql.DataSource implementation

WARNING: The code presented in this section is deprecated and not
correct/typical usage

The example before showed how to work with the Jaybird 2.1 connection
pool. However, the `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` is usually not
accessible to the application code, as it provides the ability to
manipulate physical connections. In a J2EE environment application
accesses the instance of `javax.sql.DataSource` interfaces instead. This
is usually done by wrapping the connection pool by a simple
implementation of the latter interface. Jaybird 2.1 provides such
implementation in `org.firebirdsql.pool.SimpleDataSource` class that
takes `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` as parameter in constructor.

Additionally Jaybird 2.1 provides a class that can be used in the same
was as the `FBConnectionPoolDataSource`. The next example shows how to
instantiate `FBWrappingDataSource` implementation in a client
application.

[source,java]
.Example of instantiating and using the javax.sql.DataSource implementation
----
package hello;

import java.sql.*;
import javax.sql.*;
import org.firebirdsql.pool.*;

public class HelloConnectionPool {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  
    org.firebirdsql.pool.FBWrappingDataSource pool = 
      new org.firebirdsql.pool.FBWrappingDataSource(); // <1>
      
    pool.setMaxPoolSize(5); // <2>
    pool.setMinPoolSize(2);
    pool.setMaxStatements(10);
    pool.setMaxIdleTime(30 * 60 * 60);
    
    pool.setDatabase("localhost/3050:C:/db/employee.gdb"); // <3>
    pool.setUser("SYSDBA");
    pool.setPassword("masterkey");
    
    // no step 4 as in previous example // <4>
    
    // obtain a wrapped connection    
    Connection connection = pool.getConnection(); // <5>
    try {
      // do something here...
    } finally {
      // release the connection back to pool
      connection.close(); // <6>
    }
  }
}
----

This class is called "wrapping" because it wraps the connection pool and
delegates all calls to the underlying implementation. As you can see,
the code is very similar to the example in
<<The javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource implementation>>, only few places are
different. Please note, that there is no longer a step 4, the wrapper does
this automatically in `getConnection()` method used in step 5.

=== The javax.sql.XADataSource implementation

WARNING: The code presented in this section is deprecated and not
correct/typical usage

JDBC 2.0 specification introduced the javax.sql.XADataSource interface
that should be used to access connections that can participate in
distributed transactions with JTA-compatible transaction coordinator.
This gives applications possibility to use two-phase commit to
synchronize multiple resource managers.

Jaybird 2.1 does not have separate class, but FBConnectionPoolDataSource
also implements the javax.sql.XADataSource interface. For information
how to instantiate this class please see
<<The javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource implementation>>.

Applications usually do not need to access the `javax.sql.XADataSource`
directly, this is task for a J2EE container. Chapter XXX contains more
detailed description of distributed transactions and contains code to
access and manipulate connections that participate in distributed
transactions.
