[[connection]]
== Obtaining a connection

Jaybird is a regular JDBC driver and supports two primary ways to obtain connection: via
`java.sql.DriverManager` and via an implementation of the `javax.sql.DataSource` interface.

[[connection-drivermanager]]
=== Obtaining connection java.sql.DriverManager

`java.sql.DriverManager` was the first connection factory in Java. It is based on the concept of the
JDBC URL, a string that uniquely identifies the database to connect. The driver
manager then checks which driver(s) - if any - can establish a connection.

There is also support to specify additional connection parameters, like user name and password.

A JDBC URL consists of three parts:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/c:/database/example.fdb
....

* `jdbc` +
JDBC protocol
* `firebirdsql` +
JDBC subprotocol, identifies driver to use
* `//localhost:3050/c:/database/example.fdb` 
+
This is a database specific part, and identifies the database for the driver to connect, in
the case of Jaybird that is `//<host>:<port>/<path to database>`

The first part, `jdbc:firebirdsql:` is required by JDBC and specifies the so called protocol and 
subprotocol for the JDBC connection. In other words, the type of connection that the application
wants to obtain, in this example it is a connection to a Firebird database.

An example of obtaining a connection is shown below.

[source,java]
.Simple example to obtain a JDBC connection
----
package hello;

import java.sql.*;

public class HelloServer {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  
    Class.forName("org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver"); // <1>
    
    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection( 
        "jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/c:/db/employee.fdb",
        "SYSDBA", "masterkey"); // <2>
      
    // do something here
  }
}
----

The first line of this code is important â€“ it tells Java to load the Jaybird JDBC driver. As required
by the JDBC specification, at this point driver registers itself with `java.sql.DriverManager`.

Since Java 6 (JDBC 4), explicitly loading the driver using `Class.forName("org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver")`
is no longer necessary, except when the driver is not on the system class path. Examples where it
may be necessary to explicitly load the driver are web applications that include the driver in the
deployment. There, the driver is not on the system class path, so it will need to be loaded explicitly.

We will leave out usages of `Class.forName` in further examples, they will work because of automatic
driver loading.

.Registering the JDBC driver
[NOTE]
====
There are several ways to register JDBC driver:

1. `DriverManager` loads the drivers from the system class path. This happens automatically.

2. The application explicitly loads the driver's class. This is only necessary if the automatic
loading (see previous item) is not available. This can be necessary because the driver `jar` is 
loaded dynamically, through a different classloader, etc).
+
The JDBC specification requires that during class initialization the driver registers itself with
`DriverManager`.
+
....
Class.forName("org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver");
....
3. The JDBC driver name is listed in the `jdbc.drivers` system property.
Multiple drivers can be separated using a colon (`:`).
+
You can specify the value of this property during JVM startup:
+
....
java\
  -Djdbc.drivers=foo.Driver:org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver\
  -classpath jaybird-full-{jaybird-full-version}.jar;C:/myproject/classes\
  my.company.SomeJavaExample
....
====

The second statement of the example tells the `java.sql.DriverManager`
to open a database connection to the Firebird server running on localhost, 
and the path to the database is `c:/database/employee.fdb`.

The connection specification consists of the host name of the database server, 
optionally you can specify a port (by default port 3050 is used).
The host name can be specified using either its DNS name (for example `fb-server.mycompany.com` or
just `fb-server`), or its IP address (for example `192.168.0.5`, or `[1080::8:800:200C:417A]` for 
an IPv6 address).

After the server name and port, the alias or path to the database is specified. We suggest to specify
a database alias instead of the absolute database path. For more information about using aliases, see
the documentation of Firebird server.

The format of the path depends on the platform of the Firebird server. 

On Windows, the path must include the drive letter and path, for example `c:/database/employee.fdb`, which points to the employee database that can be found in the `database` directory of drive `C:`. 
Java (and Firebird) supports either `/` or `\` (escaped as `\\`) as path separator on the Windows platform. 
On Unix and Linux platform, you can use only `/` as the path separator.

On Unix platforms the path must include the root, as the path is otherwise interpreted relative to
a server-dependent folder. Having to include the root has the effect that a database in
`/var/firebird/employee.fdb` needs to use a double `//` after the host name (and port) in the 
connection string: `jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost//var/firebird/employee.fdb`

It is possible to specify a relative path, but as this depends on the server
configuration, this may be confusing or easily lead to errors. We suggest not to use relative paths, 
and instead use an alias.

[[connection-drivermanager-props]]
==== Specifying extended properties

What if we want to specify additional connection parameters, for example a client encoding? 
The JDBC API provides a method to specify additional connection properties:

[source,java]
.Obtaining JDBC connection with additional connection properties
----
package hello;

import java.sql.*;
import java.util.*;

public class HelloServerWithEncoding {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    
    props.setProperty("user", "SYSDBA");
    props.setProperty("password", "masterkey");
    props.setProperty("encoding", "UTF8");
    
    try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
            "jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/C:/db/employee.fdb",
            props)) {
      
        // do something here
    
    }
  }
}
----

The `user` and `password` properties are defined in JDBC. All other property names, like `encoding` 
here, are driver-specific.

Additional properties, for example the SQL role for the connection can be
added to the `props` object. The list of properties available in Jaybird
can be found in <<Extended connection properties>>.

It is not always possible to use the above described method. Jaybird also provides a possibility to 
specify extended properties in the JDBC URL. 

.Extended JDBC URL format
....
jdbc:firebirdsql://host[:port]/<path to db>?<properties>
<properties> ::= <property>[{& | ;}<properties>]
<property>   ::= <name>[=<value>]
....

The example below shows the specification for extended JDBC properties in the URL.

In this case extended properties are passed together with the URL using
the HTTP-like parameter passing scheme: first comes the main part of the
URL, then `"?"`, then name-value pairs separated with `&` or `;`. This example
is equivalent to the previous example.

NOTE: Jaybird only supports URL encoding in Jaybird 4 and higher.

[source,java]
.Specifying extended properties in the JDBC URL
----
import java.sql.*;

...

Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost:3050/C:/db/employee.fdb?encoding=UTF8",
    "SYSDBA",
    "masterkey");
----

[[connection-drivermanager-props-urlencoding]]
===== URL encoding in query part of JDBC URL

[.since]_Jaybird 4_

Jaybird 4 and higher support UTF-8 URL encoded values (and keys) in the query part of the JDBC URL.

As a result of this change, the following previously unsupported characters can be used in a connection property value when escaped:

* `;` escaped as `%3B`
* `&` escaped as `%26`

In addition, the following characters must also be escaped:

* `+` in the query part now means _space_ (0x20), so occurrences of `+` (_plus_) need to be escaped as `%2B`;
make sure to do this for base64 encoded values of `dbCryptConfig`
* `%` in the query part now introduces an escape, so occurrences of `%` (_percent_) need to be escaped as `%25`

URL encoding can also be used to encode any unicode character in the query string.
Jaybird will always use UTF-8 for decoding.

Invalid URL encoded values will throw a `SQLNonTransientConnectionException`.

The support for URL encoding only applies to the JDBC URL part after the first `?`.
URL encoding should not be applied for connection properties set through `java.util.Properties` or on a `javax.sql.DataSource`.

[[connection-datasource]]
==== Obtaining a connection via javax.sql.DataSource

The JDBC 2.0 specification introduced a mechanism to obtain database connections without
requiring the application to know any specifics of the underlying JDBC driver. The application is
only required to know the logical name to find an instance of the `javax.sql.DataSource` interface
using Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). This is a common way to obtain connections in web
and application servers. Alternatively, the `DataSource` may be injected by CDI or Spring.

In order to obtain a connection via a `DataSource` object, you can use the code shown below. This code
assumes that you have correctly configured the JNDI properties. For more information about 
configuring JNDI please refer to the documentation provided with your web or application server.

[source,java]
.Typical way to obtain JDBC connection via JNDI
----
package hello;

import java.sql.*;
import javax.sql.*;
import javax.naming.*;

public class HelloServerJNDI {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  
    InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();
    DataSource ds = (DataSource)ctx.lookup("jdbc/SomeDB");

    try (Connection connection = ds.getConnection()) {
      // do something here... 
    }
  }
}
----

Usually, the binding between the `DataSource` object and its JNDI name
happens in the configuration of your web or application server. However
under some circumstances (e.g. you are developing your own JNDI-enabled
application server/framework), you may have to do this yourself. You can use
this code snippet for this purpose:

[source,java]
.Programmatic way to instantiate javax.sql.DataSource implementation
----
import javax.naming.*;
import org.firebirdsql.ds.*;
...
FBSimpleDataSource ds = new FBSimpleDataSource();

ds.setDatabase("//localhost:3050/C:/database/employee.fdb");
ds.setUser("SYSDBA");
ds.setPassword("masterkey");

InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();

ctx.bind("jdbc/SomeDB", ds);
----

The `DataSource` implementation supports all connection properties available
to the `DriverManager` interface.

[[driver-types]]
=== Driver types

As mentioned in the section <<Jaybird Architecture>>, Jaybird supports multiple 
implementations of the GDS API. The default Jaybird distribution contains two main
categories of the implementations: the pure Java implementation of the
Firebird wire protocol, and a JNA proxy that can use a Firebird `fbclient` library.

The next sections provide a description of these types and their configuration
with the corresponding JDBC URLs that should be used to
obtain the connection of desired type. The type of the JDBC driver for
the `javax.sql.DataSource` is configured via a corresponding property.

[[driver-pure-java]]
==== PURE_JAVA type

The `PURE_JAVA` type (JDBC Type 4) uses a pure Java implementation of the Firebird
wire protocol. This type is recommended for connecting to a remote
database server using TCP/IP sockets. No installation is required except
adding the JDBC driver to the class path. This type of driver provides
the best performance when connecting to a remote server.

In order to obtain a connection using the `PURE_JAVA` driver type you have
to use a JDBC URL as shown in <<Obtaining connection java.sql.DriverManager>>:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql://host[:port]/<path to database>
....

When using `javax.sql.DataSource` implementation, you can specify either
`"PURE_JAVA"` or `"TYPE4"` driver type, however this type is used by
default.

[[driver-native]]
==== NATIVE and LOCAL types

The `NATIVE` and `LOCAL` types (JDBC Type 2) use a JNA proxy to access the Firebird
client library and requires installation of the Firebird client. The
`NATIVE` driver type is used to access the remote database server, the
`LOCAL` type accesses the database server running on the same host by
means of IPC (Inter-Process Communication). Performance of `NATIVE` driver is approximately 10% lower
compared to the `PURE_JAVA` driver, but `LOCAL` type has up to 30% higher
performance compared to the `PURE_JAVA` driver when connecting the server
on the same host. This is mostly due to the fact that TCP/IP stack is
not involved in this mode.

To create a connection using the `NATIVE` JDBC driver to
connect to a remote server you have to use the following JDBC URL with
the native subprotocol:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql:native:host[/port]:<path to database>
....

When connecting to a local database server using the `LOCAL` driver, you
should use following:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql:local:<absolute path to database>
....

In addition to Jaybird, this requires a native Firebird client library, and JNA {jna-version} 
needs to be on the classpath.

[[driver-native-maven]]
===== Maven dependency for native client

When using Jaybird 3 and later, you can use a library to provide the Firebird client library for the `native` and `local` protocol.
For Windows and Linux, you can add the `org.firebirdsql.jdbc:fbclient` dependency on your classpath.
This dependency does not support the `embedded` protocol.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.firebirdsql.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>fbclient</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.4.0</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

You can also download the library (see https://github.com/mrotteveel/jaybird-fbclient#download[mrotteveel/jaybird-fbclient] for download link) and add it your classpath.

See next sections for other solutions.

[[driver-native-windows]]
===== Windows

For Jaybird 3 and later, we recommend using the solution documented in <<driver-native-maven>>.

On Windows, you need to make sure that `fbclient.dll` is located on the
`PATH` environment variable. Alternatively you can specify the directory
containing this DLL in the `jna.library.path` system property.

For example, if you put a copy of `fbclient.dll` in the current directory you have to use
the following command to start Java:

....
java -cp <relevant claspath> -Djna.library.path=. com.mycompany.MyClass
....

If your Java install is 32 bit, you need a 32 bit `fbclient.dll`, for 64 bit Java, a 64 bit `fbclient.dll`.

[[driver-native-linux]]
===== Linux

For Jaybird 3 and later, we recommend using the solution documented in <<driver-native-maven>>.

On Linux, you need to make sure that `libfbclient.so` is available through 
the `LD_PATH` environment variable.

Usually shared libraries are stored in the `/usr/lib/` directory; however you will need 
root permissions to install the library there. Some distributions will only have,
for example, `libfbclient.so.2.5`. In that case you may need to add a symlink from `libfbclient.so` 
to the client on your system.

Alternatively you can specify the directory containing the library in the `jna.library.path`
Java system property. See the Windows example above for more details.

[[driver-native-limitations]]
===== Limitations

*TODO* Section might be outdated

Firebird client library is not thread-safe when connecting to a local
database server using IPC. Jaybird provides the necessary
synchronization in Java code using a static object instance. However,
this static object instance is local to the classloader that has loaded
the Jaybird classes.

In order to guarantee correct synchronization , the Jaybird driver must
be loaded by the top-most classloader. For example, when using the Type
2 JDBC driver with a web or application server, you have to add the
Jaybird classes to the main classpath (for example, to the `lib/`
directory of your web or application server), but *not* to the web or
Jave EE application, e.g. the `WEB-INF/lib` directory.

[[driver-embedded]]
==== EMBEDDED type

The Embedded server JDBC driver is a Type 2 JDBC driver that, rather
than using the Firebird client library, loads the Firebird embedded server
library instead. This is the highest performance type of JDBC driver for
accessing local databases, as the Java code accesses the database file
directly.

In order to obtain a connection via DriverManager you have to use
following URL:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql:embedded:<path to database>

jdbc:firebirdsql:embedded:host[/port]:<path to database>
....

When host and, optionally, port is specified, embedded server acts as
client library (i.e. you get the same Type 2 behavior as you would get
with using "native").

This driver tries to load `fbembed.dll/libfbembed.so` and `fbclient.dll/libfbclient.so`,
the last - of course - only works if that fbclient provides Firebird embedded.

See also the <<NATIVE and LOCAL types>> section.

When using Firebird 3 embedded, you will need to make sure the necessary plugins like
`engine12.dll/libengine12.so` are accessible to the client library, consult the 
Firebird 3 documentation for more information. For an example, see the article
https://www.lawinegevaar.nl/firebird/jaybird_embedded_example.html[Jaybird with Firebird embedded example^]

// TODO Extend documentation

[[driver-embedded-limitations]]
===== Limitations

*TODO* Section might be outdated

The Firebird embedded server for Linux is not thread safe. Jaybird
provides the needed synchronization in Java code, similar to the one
described for the Type 2 JDBC driver. This implies the same restrictions
on the classloader that will load the Jaybird classes.

The Firebird embedded server for Windows opens databases in exclusive
mode. This means that this particular database is accessible only to one
Java virtual machine. _There is no exclusive mode on the POSIX platform.
When the same database file is accessed by multiple JVM instances,
database will be corrupted!_

[[driver-ooremote]]
==== OOREMOTE type

The `OOREMOTE` type is a JDBC Type 4 specifically for use with OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice. It 
addresses some differences in interpretation of the JDBC specification, and provides alternative
metadata in certain cases to allow OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice to function correctly.

// TODO Expand on differences?

[NOTE]
====
This only describes connecting to Firebird using Jaybird from OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice,
it is not about the Firebird embedded use that has been introduced in recent LibreOffice versions.
====

In order to obtain a connection you have to use following URL:

....
jdbc:firebirdsql:oo://host[:port]/<path to database>
....

All other notes for <<driver-pure-java>> apply.

[[connection-pooling]]
=== Connection Pooling

Each time a connection is opened via `DriverManager`, a new physical
connection to server is opened. It is closed when the connection is
closed. In order to avoid the overhead of creating connections, you can use 
a connection pool implementation to maintain a cache of open physical
connections that can be reused between user sessions.

Since version 3.0, Jaybird no longer provides a connection pool. If you need
a `javax.sql.DataSource` implementation that provides a connection pool, either use the
connection pool support of your application server, or consider using https://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/[HikariCP^], 
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/[DBCP^], or http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/[c3p0^].

[[data-source-implementation]]
=== The javax.sql.DataSource implementation

Connection pool implementations, whether provided by a Java EE application server or
a third-party library, are exposed as an implementation of the `javax.sql.DataSource` interface.

The most important method exposed by this interface is the `getConnection()` method, which will
return a connection based on the configuration of the data source. For a 'basic' (non-pooling) data 
source this will create a new, physical, connection. For a connection pool, this will create a logical
connection that wraps a physical connection from the pool. 

[NOTE]
====
The 'user' of a connection should not care whether the connection is pooled or not, the
connection should behave the same from the perspective of the user, and the user should use the
connection in the same way. This should allow for swapping between a non-pooling and pooling
data source in an application without any changes to the code using the data source.
====

When the application is done with the connection, it should call `close()` on the connection. 
A connection from a non-pooling data source will be closed. For a logical connection from a 
connection pool, `close()` will invalidate the logical connection (which will make it 
behave like a closed connection), and return the underlying physical connection to the 
connection pool, where it will be either kept for re-use, or maybe closed.

[TIP]
====
Use a connection for the shortest scope (and time) necessary for correct behaviour. Get a connection,
and close it as soon as you're done. When using a connection pool, this has the added benefit that just
a few connections can serve the needs of the application.
====

[[connection-pool-data-source-implementation]]
=== The javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource implementation

The `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` interface represents a factory that creates
`PooledConnection` objects for use by a connection pool. For example, application servers
support the use of a `ConnectionPoolDataSource` to populate their connection pool.

A `PooledConnection` instance represents a physical connection to a database and is a source
of logical connections that a connection pool can hand out to the application. Closing this 
logical connection returns the physical connection back into the pool.

[WARNING]
====
Contrary to its name, a `ConnectionPoolDataSource` is not a connection pool!
====

Jaybird provides `org.firebirdsql.ds.FBConnectionPoolDataSource` as an implementation of the
`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` interface.

*TODO* Add more info

[[xa-data-source-implementation]]
=== The javax.sql.XADataSource implementation

The JDBC 2.0 specification introduced the `javax.sql.XADataSource` interface
that should be used to access connections that can participate in
distributed transactions with JTA-compatible transaction coordinator.
This gives applications possibility to use two-phase commit to
synchronize multiple resource managers.

Just like `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`, applications normally don't access
an `XADataSource` implementation directly, instead it is used as a factory of connections for
an XA-enabled data source. To the application this is usually exposed as a `javax.sql.DataSource`.

Jaybird provides `org.firebirdsql.ds.FBXADataSource` as an implementation of 
the `javax.sql.XADataSource` interface.
