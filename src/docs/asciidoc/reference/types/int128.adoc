=== Type INT128

[.since]_Firebird 4.0_

Firebird 4.0 introduced the non-standard type `INT128`, a signed 128 bit number.

==== Support for INT128

[.since]_Jaybird 4.0.1_

Jaybird 4.0.1 introduced support for the `INT128` type.
Jaybird 4.0.0 will also be able to handle the type, but does not formally identify it as `INT128`.

As JDBC does not define an `INT128` type, Jaybird maps the Firebird type `INT128` to the JDBC type `NUMERIC` with precision of 38.
This way most tools should be able to handle the full range of values of without issue.

For details on numeric, see <<ref-decimal>>.

The introduction of this type is specified by https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/jaybird/blob/master/devdoc/jdp/jdp-2020-08-int128-support.md[jdp-2020-08 Int128 support^].
