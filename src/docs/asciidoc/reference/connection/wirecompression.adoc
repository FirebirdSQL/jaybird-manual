=== Wire compression

[.since]_Jaybird 4_ +
[.since]_Firebird 3_

Jaybird 4 added support for zlib wire compression in the pure Java wire protocol.
Compression can be enabled using boolean connection property `wireCompression`.

The connection property only has effect for the pure Java wire protocol connections on Firebird 3 and higher, if the server has the zlib library.
Native connections will follow the `WireCompression` configuration in the `firebird.conf` read by the client library, if the zlib library is on the search path.

Compression is currently disabled by default.
This may change in future versions of Jaybird to be enabled by default.

The `wireCompression` property is also available on data sources and the management classes in `org.firebirdsql.management`.
