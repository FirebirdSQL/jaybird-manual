Manual for [Jaybird](https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/jaybird), the Firebird JDBC driver.

Status
======

This manual is in the process of being converted from ODT (OpenDocument) to 
markdown. At the moment the markdown version is incomplete; it is missing 
images, source code examples, tables and other information that could not be
automatically converted from the OpenDocument version.

Latest release
==============

The latest published version of this manual is [Jaybird 2.1 JDBC driver Java Programmer's Manual](http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/drivers_documentation/Jaybird_2_1_JDBC_driver_manual.pdf)

Supporting information
======================

This project uses [pandoc](http://pandoc.org), which is not always compatible
with the markdown rendering of GitHub.

Reporting bugs
==============

Please don't report bugs until the conversion is complete (see [Status](#status)).
