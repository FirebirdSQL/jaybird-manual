The latest published version of this manual is [Jaybird 2.1 JDBC driver Java Programmer's Manual](http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/drivers_documentation/Jaybird_2_1_JDBC_driver_manual.pdf)

This version was created from the old ODT version; its rendering doesn't match
the rendering of the current markdown version.

This project uses [pandoc](http://pandoc.org), which is not always compatible
with the markdown rendering of GitHub.
